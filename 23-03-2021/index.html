    <h1>Hi, my name is Kevin Cervantes</h1>
    <h2>And this is the summary of today's lesson:</h2>
    <div>
        <p>Today we learned how every tool involved in the front-end works behind. 
            <span class="italics">HTML</span>  and <span class="italics">CSS</span>  
            create binary trees with the tags user writes down in a classic 
            <span class="italics">.html</span>  and <span class="italics">.css</span> 
            file respectively.
        </p>

        <p>In the other hand, <span class="italics">Javascript</span>  manipulates 
            those objects in order to add the behaviour we want our html files to have.
        </p>

        <p>
            Finnaly, text editors like <span class="italics">Visual Studio</span>  provide 
            the users with useful tools like Live Server wich allow us to run easily a html file 
            and <span class="underline">see all the changes we made to it in real time</span> .
